**Searchbin.sh**
The searchbin.sh script is a command-line utility designed to search the Linux /bin directory based on specific options and arguments provided by the user. The script supports three options: -s for string search, -b for binary size search, and -l to find symbolic links. String Search (-s): This option allows the user to search for binaries that contain a specified string. The string argument is case-insensitive.
Binary Size Search (-b): This option enables the user to search for binaries that match a specific size condition. The user must provide an operator (GT, LT, LE, GE, EQ, NE) and a byte value.
Symbolic Link Search (-l): This option returns binary names that are symbolic links to another binary, and the alternate binary each points to.
The script validates all options and arguments passed at the command line. If no flag/argument is provided, or if multiple options/arguments are passed, the script terminates with an appropriate error message. The script also ensures that the output is displayed in a fully-aligned columnar format. If no matches are found for any particular search, the user is informed with an appropriate message.
The script is designed to run in any directory and does not modify the /bin directory. It also cleans up any files or folders created during its execution. The script is named searchbin.sh and includes comments explaining the code elements it.
